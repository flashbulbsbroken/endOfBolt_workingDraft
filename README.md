# endOfBolt_workingDraft
This is the solo project I started working on while attending Prime Digital Academy, End of Bolt.  

In my freetime I am a quilter and with that comes a large collection of fabric.  End of Bolt is a inventory application, that allows quilters access to their fabric collection wherever they are.  

Users can upload images of their fabric and add information, such as name, collection, manufacturer, yardage, etc. Then the images are displayed in a grid and can be clicked on to enlarge and show the information for that fabric.  

Future goals for this project include - adding sorting options, integrate social components, assign fabric to projects, editing functionality
